Hi, I’m Jeff Huang — an engineer and builder driven by the challenge of turning complex systems into intelligent, impactful solutions.

I’m currently exploring the convergence of **artificial intelligence**, **financial modeling**, and **distributed computing**, with a focus on designing systems that scale, adapt, and learn. My work spans from backend development and algorithmic trading infrastructure to research in applied machine learning and real-time data processing.

Previously, I’ve contributed to:

- Quantitative tools for market signal analysis
- Large-scale backend systems optimized for performance and reliability
- AI-driven prototypes in robotics and automation

Beyond the code, I believe in clarity, continuous iteration, and pushing boundaries. I'm always exploring new technologies — not just for novelty, but for how they can solve real problems better, faster, or more elegantly.

When I’m not experimenting with new frameworks or debugging pipelines, I enjoy thoughtful games, deep dives into systems theory, and refining my understanding of how tech can shape decision-making.
