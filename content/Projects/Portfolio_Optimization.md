In recent years, the intersection of machine learning and quantitative finance has opened new opportunities for more accurate and adaptive investment strategies. This project explores the integration of two powerful tools: the  **Transformer model** , a deep learning architecture originally developed for natural language processing, and the  **Markowitz portfolio theory** , a classical framework for risk-return optimization in portfolio management.

The **Transformer model** excels at capturing complex, time-dependent patterns in sequential data using a mechanism known as  *self-attention* . This allows the model to learn relationships between distant points in a sequence without relying on recurrence, making it well-suited for forecasting tasks in financial time series where market signals are often subtle and spread out over time.

The  **Markowitz portfolio theory** , also known as mean-variance optimization, provides a mathematical foundation for constructing portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk. It relies on estimates of expected returns, variances, and covariances among assets to determine the optimal asset allocation.

By combining the predictive power of Transformers with the robust optimization framework of Markowitz, this project aims to generate more informed asset return forecasts and translate them into portfolios with improved risk-adjusted performance.
